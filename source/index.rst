Manual of LModeA-nano
=======================================



This manual focuses on the LModeA-nano as a PyMOL plugin designed to perform 
Local Vibrational Mode Analysis on both solids and molecules. This theoretical tool
can quantify the intrinsic strength of chemical bonds in terms of local stretching force constant.

[2022-09-26] LModeA-nano was employed by Prof. Peter W. Roesky's research group to investigate the existence of Si-Si bonding within silylene compounds in their work titled **Stimuli Responsive Silylene: Electromerism Induced Reversible Switching Between Mono- and Bis-Silylene** published on *Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.*

[2021-12-20] Our work titled **Capturing Individual Hydrogen Bond Strengths in Ices via Periodic Local Vibrational Mode Theory: Beyond the Lattice Energy Picture** was published on *J. Chem. Theory Comput.*
