Manual of LModeA-nano
=======================================



This manual focuses on the LModeA-nano as a PyMOL plugin designed to perform 
Local Vibrational Mode Analysis on both solids and molecules. This theoretical tool
can quantify the intrinsic strength of chemical bonds in terms of local stretching force constant.
