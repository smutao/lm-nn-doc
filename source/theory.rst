=============================
Local Vibrational Mode Theory
=============================



The *local vibrational mode theory* was originally developed by Konkoli and Cremer in 1998 :ref:`[1-4] <target to references>` and it describes  the theoretical  *adiabatic internal modes* (later known as *local vibrational modes*) derived from the experimentally measurable *normal vibrational modes* :ref:`[5] <target to references>` in molecular structures by solving the mass-decoupled Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations.      


A local vibrational mode  associated with an internal coordinate parameter :math:`q_n` is defined as the infinitesimal displacement of this internal coordinate, followed by the relaxation of all other atoms in this molecular structure. 
 
Like normal vibrational modes having their corresponding frequencies and force constants, a local vibrational mode has its local mode force constant  :math:`k_n^a` (also known as *relaxed force constant*) and frequency  :math:`\omega_n^a`. 
For the local vibrational mode associated with a bond length,  the local mode force constant corresponds to the *local stretching force constant* describes the intrinsic strength of this chemical bond of interest. 
:math:`k_n^a` as a  unique measure of bond strength  as  an alternative to the bond (dissociation) energy of covalent bond or binding energy of non-covalent interaction has its advantages over the latter bond strength measure. 


In 2019, the *local vibrational mode theory*  was extended from molecular systems to periodic systems of one through three dimensions (1-3D) in periodicity :ref:`[6] <target to references>`. The local vibrational mode associated with  an internal coordinate :math:`q_n` is defined as the   vibration driven by this internal coordinate in all primitive cells while relaxing all other parts of the periodic system. This theoretical extension enables the quantification of chemical bond strengths in solids and  molecules in a head-to-head fashion.

So far, the local vibrational mode theory as a powerful tool has been applied to study both covalent bonds and non-covalent interactions including hydrogen, halogen, pnicogen, chalcogen and tetrel bonding. Interested readers may check a review article by Kraka *et al.* :ref:`[7] <target to references>`. 


Necessary input information needed for calculating the local vibrational modes in molecules or solids includes 

* optimized molecular structure or primitive cell structure 

*   Hessian matrix corresponding to the optimized structure

Hessian matrix collecting the second-order energy derivatives with regard to Cartesian coordinates is   necessary for vibrational frequency calculations in molecules and solids. 


Next, tutorials will be given on how to use LModeA-nano with the input data generated by :ref:`solid-state <solid-model>` and :ref:`quantum chemistry  <qc-model>` modeling packages.
